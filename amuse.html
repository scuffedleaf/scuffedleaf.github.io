        Felix Lengyel, also known as "XQC" is a popular twitch streamer. 
        He plays a lot of video games and his reactions to situations are hilarious. 
        He speaks very fast, which makes it very hard to decipher what he's saying. 
        He's one of the streamers that I always look forward to watching.

        Daily Dose of Internet is a popular youtube channel that posts a 
        bunch of random interesting videos of people doing cool and fun things. 
        Sometimes if you don't know what to watch, or what to do, 
        you can't go wrong with getting your Daily Dose of Internet.

      <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
        Talking Kitty Cat is a series on youtube that I hold dearly. It's these funny videos of this guy's cats "talking" to him and just causing a bunch of chaos around the house. Even though the series ended I sometimes still watch some of the videos.

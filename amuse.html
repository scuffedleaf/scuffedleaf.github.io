         Felix Lengyel, also known as "XQC" is a popular twitch streamer. 
        <br> He plays a lot of video games and his reactions to situations are hilarious. 
        <br> He speaks very fast, which makes it very hard to decipher what he's saying. 
        <br> He's one of the streamers that I always look forward to watching.

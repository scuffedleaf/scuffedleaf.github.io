         Felix Lengyel, also known as "XQC" is a popular twitch streamer. 
        <br> He plays a lot of video games and his reactions to situations are hilarious. 
        <br> He speaks very fast, which makes it very hard to decipher what he's saying. 
        <br> He's one of the streamers that I always look forward to watching.

      <p style="font-size: 18px"> 
             Talking Kitty Cat is a series on youtube that I hold dearly.  
        <br> It's these funny videos of this guy's cats "talking" to him and 
        <br> just causing a bunch of chaos around the house. Even though the 
        <br> series ended I sometimes still watch some of the videos.

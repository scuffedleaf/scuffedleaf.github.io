    <h2> What makes someone impactful??</h2>
    <p> Do they have to be real? Do they have to solve the world's biggest problems? Well to me, it is someone who inspires us to be better.</p>
    <p> To be more observing. Gives us the drive to strive for knowledge.</p>
    <p> One of my favorite quotes comes from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <cite>Sherlock Holmes: His Last Bow:</cite> </p>
    <p><b><em>“Education never ends, Watson. <br>It is a series of lessons, <br> with the greatest for the last.”</em></b></p>
